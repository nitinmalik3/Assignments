 <h1>Recipies - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
                    <p>I adopted this recipie from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger . Ever since tasting these eggs on my first visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross,Sydney.
                        I have been after the recipie. I have transformed it into what i really believe are the best scrambled eggs i have ever tasted.
                    </p>
                    <p>This recipie is what i call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why it has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
